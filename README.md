## Reflection:
This assignment was very difficult. We spent a lot of time trying to decide what to make our project about, and had a hard time getting everything going. We were a bit lax in assigning tasks, and sticking to deadlines or at least check-ins throughout the week to make sure that we were on track. Unfortunately, we did not use any organizational application such as Trello which we deeply regret. We had a few issues finding a viable public APIs, and once we found APIs that would be promising for the strains and the photos, we quickly realized that they were fairly difficult to work with. As time went on, we realized that there were so many little parts that needed to be done and accounted for. We tried to find a lot of work arounds considering we were using an APIs and CSS framework that didn't have a lot of documentation available, and/or weren't easy to figure out in general. 

This is definitely a project we want to continue to refine and polish. We initially wanted to have a "Favorite's" page so that users would be able to save their favorite strains as a reference for later, but couldn't quite figure it out in time, and we ended up hiding the Favorite's Page as well as the Favorite's button before the presentation. We are happy that we were at least able to get the dropdown search function to load, and also the aesthetic themes that we implemented to make the page visually more inviting.
Overall, this project really brought a lot to light. We realized the areas we really needed to improve upon as well as organization and assigning tasks. We got a better handle of how to work Gitbash, but could still use a vast amount of improvement.

It was great to see what it's like to work together as a group and implement GitHub, as well as how to merge files when multiple people were involved in editing. We had a lot of hiccups, but managed to put forth a fairly viable product. Overall, it was really fun, albeit quite stressful, to put this project together and it was truly a learning experience. We learned a lot, and quickly realized what areas we needed to improve upon in the moment as well as going forward. Though the outcome wasn't quite what we had envisioned, we are looking forward correcting and fine-tuning the project to meet the standards that we had originally set out to accomplish.
